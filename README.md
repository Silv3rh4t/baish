# BAiSH — Your AI-Powered Terminal Assistant

BAiSH is a terminal tool that turns plain English into shell commands using OpenRouter-powered LLMs like GPT-4, Mistral, Claude, and others.

No more Googling for syntax or stackoverflow diving. Just ask, and BAiSH will suggest the right command — with options to preview, explain, and save as aliases.

## Features

- Converts natural language to terminal commands
- Supports `--explain` mode for breakdowns
- `--dry` run mode to preview before execution
- Alias system (`baish alias deploy 'git push'`)
- Persistent config (API key + default model)
- One-time `--key` and `--model` overrides
- Built on Node.js + OpenRouter + your preferred LLM
